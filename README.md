# MongooseOS Docker Build

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/suculent/mongoose-docker-build.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/suculent/mongoose-docker-build/) [![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/suculent/mongoose-docker-build.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/suculent/mongoose-docker-build/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/suculent/mongoose-docker-build/blob/master/LICENSE)

Run the [MongooseOS](https://mongoose-os.com) command-line builder in a docker container. This image will take it from there and turn your MongooseOS project into a binary which you then can [flash to the ESP8266](http://nodemcu.readthedocs.org/en/dev/en/flash/).


## Target audience

- Application developers

  They just need a ready-made firmware.

- Occasional firmware hackers

  They don't need full control over the complete tool chain and don't want to setup a Linux VM with the build environment.

**This image has been created for purposes of the [THiNX OpenSource IoT management platform](https://thinx.cloud).**


## Usage

### Install Docker
Follow the instructions at [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

### Run this image with Docker
Start terminal and change to the your MongooseOS project directory. Then run:

``docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`:/opt/mongoose-builder suculent/mongoose-docker-build``

Depending on the performance of your system it takes 1-3min until the compilation finishes. The first time you run this it takes longer because Docker needs to download the image and create a container.

:bangbang: If you have previously pulled this Docker image (e.g. with the command above) you should update the image from time to time to pull in the latest bug fixes:

`docker pull suculent/mongoose-docker-build`

**Note for Windows users**

(Docker on) Windows handles paths slightly differently. The command thus becomes (`c` equals C drive i.e. `c:`):

`docker run --rm -it -v //c/Users/<user>/<mongoose-builder>:/opt/mongoose-builder suculent/mongoose-docker-build`

If the Windows path contains spaces it would have to be wrapped in quotes as usual on Windows.

`docker run --rm -it -v "//c/Users/monster tune/<mongoose-builder>"/opt/mongoose-builder suculent/mongoose-docker-build``

#### Output
The firmware file is created in the `bin` sub folder of your root directory. You will also find a mapfile in the `bin` folder with the same name as the firmware file but with a `.map` ending.

#### Options
You can pass the following optional parameters to the Docker build like so `docker run -e "<parameter>=value" -e ...`.

- `WORKDIR` Just an parametrization example, will deprecate or be used for additional libraries.

### Flashing the built binary
There are several [tools to flash the firmware](http://nodemcu.readthedocs.org/en/dev/en/flash/) to the ESP8266. If you were to use [esptool](https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool) (like I do) you'd run:

`esptool.py --port <USB-port-with-ESP8266> write_flash 0x00000 <mongoose-builder>/bin/__TO__BE__DEFINED__LATER__.bin `

## Support
Don't leave comments on Docker Hub that are intended to be support requests. First, Docker Hub doesn't notify me when you write them, second I can't properly reply and third even if I could often it doesn't make much sense to keep them around forever and a day. Instead ask a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and assign the `mongooseos` and `docker` tags.

For bugs and improvement suggestions create an issue at [https://github.com/suculent/mongoose-docker-build/issues](https://github.com/suculent/platformio-docker-build/issues).
